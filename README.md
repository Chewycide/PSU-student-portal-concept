### Creating a python virtual environment
*For windows*
- Open Windows File Explorer
- Navigate to the root folder/directory of the project
- Open the command prompt by typing `cmd` at the address bar.
- Enter the following code in the command prompt: 
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
    - After that, a ".venv" folder will be created. You will need to activate the virtual environment by typing:
    ```
    .venv/Scripts/activate.bat

    or

    ".venv/Scripts/activate.bat"
    ```
    - When you see a `(.venv)` it means the virtual environment is now activated.
- Before proceeding to code, you need to install the required libraries/framework.

### Installing requirements
- To do this you to type the following at the command prompt:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- After that you can now proveed to code.
